= TralhaController

TralhaController is a class to observe URL changes and notify registered clients. It's
useful to mantain permalinks on webpags that uses ajax.

== Example

Firstly we register an observer on TralhaController:

  TralhaController.addObserver( { 
    updade: function(url) {
      //Made ajax request  
    }
  } );

Say we have link that mark the URL with a #:

  <a href="#getinformation">Get Information</a>

When a user clicks on this link, the URL changes:

 http://www.example.com/index.html#getinformation

So the object observing the URL is notifed with the new URL on update method.

If this user sends that URL for a friend, this friend will see the same content because 
the update method will be called with the same URL.

== Known Issues

When you add more than one observer, only the first is notified when page is first loaded.
